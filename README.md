# Hyperparameter-Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is the process of optimizing the parameters that define a machine learning model. By adjusting these parameters, the performance of the model can be improved. This can be a critical step in developing a successful machine learning model.
This project focused on predicting cirrhosis using k-nearest neighbors algorithm, with a goal to enhance the model's accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
